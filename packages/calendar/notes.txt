Notes
	- Settle on an API when composing the parts.
	  - Whats the best way to handle literal segments?
	- Implement popover functionality.
	- Maybe don't allow asChild on root element? (Seen on Radix)
	- Maybe move all the min / max checking into the state hook / Date class?
	- Should we use utility functions instead of CalendarDate class?


Improvements
	- Make CalendarDateSegments configurable to not include literals
