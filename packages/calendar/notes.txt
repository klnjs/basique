To Solve
	- Settle on an API when composing the parts.
	- Implement popover functionality.
	- Maybe don't allow asChild on root element? (Seen on Radix)
	- Maybe move all the min / max checking into the state hook / Date class?
	- Maybe improve CalendarDate API
		- Should we separate utility functions from the class?
		- Should it internally always mutate or return new date?
