To Solve
	- Settle on an API when composing the parts.
	- Find a better way to do keyboard handlers, too many preventDefault.
	- Not happy with the state / config hooks, too much overlap-
	- Implement popover functionality.
	- Improve CalendarDate API
		- Should we separate utility functions from the class?
		- Should it internally always mutate or return new date?
